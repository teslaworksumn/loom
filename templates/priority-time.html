        <h1>Scheduled Priority Time</h1>
        <p>Priority time was invented under the premise that even when a group really needs to use the Labs at a specific time, they likely won't need an <em>entire</em> room or <em>every</em> machine.</p>
        <p>Therefore, when a group has priority time they have not made a reservation - instead, they are only given the authority to request immediate use of a work spot or machine they need.</p>
        
        <p>With priority time, you <strong>can:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask to use a machine someone is working on if you need it</li>
            <li>Ask someone to evacuate a space you need to work in</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>With priority time, you <strong>cannot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask to use a machine someone is working on, but use it non-productively (Facebook)</li>
            <li>"Reserve" the entire room. Other people are allowed to fill the face </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This system only works if priority time is the exception, not something that is reserved regularly or defensively. Therefore, <strong>reserve as little priority time as you can</strong> and only with a specific and good reason.</p>
        
        <p>To reserve priority time in the Labs, contact your group's officers. See you around!</p>
